# Learn J2K: a step-by-step tutorial

This tutorial teaches the language by small programs. Each program was compiled and run to produce the output you see.
You need the compiler (see the README: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J2k-studio/Jcmp/main/install.sh | sh`).
Type a program into a file such as `hello.jk`, then:

```bash
jcmp hello.jk -o hello      # compile
./hello                     # run
```

For the complete list of features see [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md); for the command line see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

## Lesson 1. Hello, world

Every program starts at `main`. `cout <<` prints; `\n` is a new line. Save this as `hello.jk`.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    cout << "Hello, J2K!\n";
}
```

Output:

```
Hello, J2K!
```

Compile and run: `jcmp hello.jk -o hello` then `./hello`. If you made a typo, the compiler tells you the file, line and column
and shows the line with a `^` under the problem.
**Try:** print your own name.

## Lesson 2. Numbers and variables

A variable has a type: `int` (whole number, 64 bit), `double` (decimal), `char` (one character), `bool` (true or false).
`cout` prints decimals too. Lines end with `;`.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    int apples = 5;
    int pears = 3;
    int total = apples + pears;
    cout << "total = " << total << "\n";

    double price = 2.5;
    cout << "cost = " << price * 4.0 << "\n";

    char letter = 'J';
    cout << letter << "\n";

    bool enough = total > 7;
    if enough { cout << "enough fruit\n"; }
}
```

Output:

```
total = 8
cost = 10.000000
J
enough fruit
```

A `bool` is not a number: `if total` is an error, write `if total != 0`. Likewise `int` and `double` do not mix without a cast:
`(double)total`.

## Lesson 3. Making decisions

`if`, `else if`, `else` choose what to run. Conditions use `== != < > <= >=` and `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not). Braces are always needed.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    int score = 72;
    if score >= 90 {
        cout << "A\n";
    } else if score >= 70 {
        cout << "B\n";
    } else {
        cout << "C\n";
    }
    bool passed = score >= 50 && score <= 100;
    if passed { cout << "passed\n"; }
}
```

Output:

```
B
passed
```

**Try:** change `score` and see which letter you get.

## Lesson 4. Loops

`while` repeats while a condition is true. `for i in a..b` counts from `a` up to `b - 1`. The C-style `for` is also there.
`break` leaves a loop, `continue` skips to the next round.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    int i = 1;
    while i <= 3 {
        cout << i << " ";
        i++;
    }
    cout << "\n";

    for k in 0..5 { cout << k * k << " "; }
    cout << "\n";

    for int j = 10; j > 0; j -= 3 { cout << j << " "; }
    cout << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
1 2 3 
0 1 4 9 16 
10 7 4 1 
```

**Try:** print the multiplication table of 7.

## Lesson 5. Functions

A function has a result type, a name and parameters. `void` means no result. A function can be written below the place that uses it.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    cout << square(7) << "\n";
    cout << sum_to(10) << "\n";
    greet("Ann");
}

int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int sum_to(int n) {
    int s = 0;
    for i in 1..n + 1 { s += i; }
    return s;
}

void greet(char^ name) {
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!\n";
}
```

Output:

```
49
55
Hello, Ann!
```

`char^` means "pointer to characters": that is how text is passed to a function.

## Lesson 6. Arrays and text

`int scores[5]` is five numbers, counted from 0. `scores.len` is its length. Text is an array of `char` that ends with a 0;
`char word[] = "banana"` sizes it for you. Arrays can have up to three dimensions: `int grid[2][3]`.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    int scores[5];
    for i in 0..5 { scores[i] = (i + 1) * 10; }
    int total = 0;
    for i in 0..scores.len { total += scores[i]; }
    cout << "total " << total << "\n";

    char word[] = "banana";
    int count = 0;
    for i in 0..word.len {
        if word[i] == 'a' { count++; }
    }
    cout << word << " has " << count << " letter a\n";

    int grid[2][3];
    for r in 0..2 {
        for c in 0..3 { grid[r][c] = r * 3 + c; }
    }
    cout << grid[1][2] << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
total 150
banana has 3 letter a
5
```

Build with `jcmp prog.jk -d -o prog` to stop with a message when an index is outside the array.

## Lesson 7. Reading input

`cin >> a >> b;` reads words from the keyboard. The type of the variable decides what is read: a number for `int`,
a word for a `char` array. `cin` reads decimals too. Words are separated by spaces or new lines.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    char name[20];
    int age;
    cin >> name >> age;
    cout << name << " will be " << age + 1 << " next year\n";
}
```

Input: `Ann 30`

Output:

```
Ann will be 31 next year
```

Run it and type `Ann 30` (or pipe it in: `echo "Ann 30" | ./input`). Bad input throws an error you can catch (the lesson on try and catch).

## Lesson 8. Lines, numbers and keys: read

`cin` reads words. When you want a whole line, a number from a line, or an answer to a question, the module `read` (`using Input;`) does it: `read.line()`, `read.number()`, `read.yes("question")`. `read.enter()` waits for Enter and `read.key()` waits for one key without Enter (see below).

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;
using Input;

void main() {
    cout << "name? ";
    String name = read.line();
    cout << "age? ";
    int age = read.number();
    cout << name << " will be " << age + 1 << " next year\n";
    if read.yes("again?") { cout << "ok\n"; } else { cout << "bye\n"; }
}
```

Input: `Ann
30
y`

Output:

```
name? age? Ann will be 31 next year
again? [y/n] ok
```

`read.number()` throws an error when the line is not a whole number (`read.try_number()` gives a `Result` instead). `read.key()` gives the code of the key, with no echo and no Enter: letters are their codes, Escape is 27, and the arrows are 257 (up), 258 (down), 259 (right), 260 (left); at the end of the input it is -1. That is how a game or a menu reads the keyboard. Use `read` or `cin` in one program, not both.

## Lesson 9. Structs and methods

A `struct` groups values. Functions inside it are methods; they receive the object as `self`. `Rect r = {3, 4};` fills the fields in order.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

struct Rect {
    int w;
    int h;

    int area(self) {
        return self.w * self.h;
    }

    void grow(self, int d) {
        self.w += d;
        self.h += d;
    }
}

void main() {
    Rect r = {3, 4};
    cout << r.area() << "\n";
    r.grow(1);
    cout << r.w << "x" << r.h << " area " << r.area() << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
12
4x5 area 20
```

A method called `init(self)` runs automatically when a variable is created without `{ ... }`. `static` functions have no `self` and are
called as `Rect::name(...)`.

## Lesson 10. Enums and switch

An `enum class` is a list of named values. `switch` picks the case that matches, with no fall-through; `_` is "anything else".
An enum is not a number, so you cannot mix them up by accident.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

enum class Light { Red, Yellow, Green };

void say(Light l) {
    switch l {
        Light::Red: cout << "stop\n";
        Light::Yellow: cout << "slow down\n";
        Light::Green: cout << "go\n";
    }
}

void main() {
    say(Light::Green);
    say(Light::Red);

    int n = 3;
    switch n {
        1, 2: cout << "small\n";
        3: cout << "three\n";
        _: cout << "other\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
go
stop
three
```

If a `switch` on an enum forgets a member, the compiler warns you (use `-st` to make warnings errors).

## Lesson 11. Pointers

`@x` is the address of `x`. `int^ p` is a pointer to an int; `p^` is the value it points to. A pointer lets a function change its caller's variable.
`p[i]` reaches the i-th element (there is no `p + 1`).

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void bump(int^ p) {
    p^ = p^ + 1;
}

void main() {
    int n = 5;
    bump(@n);
    bump(@n);
    cout << n << "\n";

    int a[3];
    a[0] = 10; a[1] = 20; a[2] = 30;
    int^ q = @a;
    cout << q[1] << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
7
20
```

## Lesson 12. Growing arrays and memory

`int[] list = arr(4)` is a dynamic array: it starts empty and grows with `push`. `alloc(n)` gives raw memory. The compiler frees what a
local variable made with `arr` or `alloc` at the end of the block, so you rarely call `free` yourself.

```jk
#import <stdlib>

using stdlib;
int total(int[] list) {
    int s = 0;
    for i in 0..list.len { s += list[i]; }
    return s;
}

void main() {
    int[] squares = arr(4);
    for i in 1..6 { squares.push(i * i); }
    cout << squares.len << " items, total " << total(squares) << "\n";

    int^ buffer = (int^)alloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    buffer[0] = 7;
    buffer[1] = 8;
    buffer[2] = 9;
    cout << buffer[0] + buffer[2] << "\n";
}   // squares and buffer are freed here
```

Output:

```
5 items, total 55
16
```

Handing memory to someone else: `return p;`, storing it in a field, or `move(p)`. A `-d` build tells you at the end how many blocks were never freed.

## Lesson 13. Strings

`String` holds text that can grow. `String s = "hello";` makes a copy of the text; `a + b` joins; `==` compares; `s.len` is the length and `s[i]` one character.
Methods: `push`, `append`, `pop`, `clear`, `find`, `slice(from, to)`, `c()` (the characters as a plain text). `cin >> s` reads one word.
A `String` is freed at the end of its block, and `String b = a;` makes a separate copy.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

String shout(String s) {
    String r = s + "!";
    return r;
}

void main() {
    String a = "abc";
    String b = a;
    b.push('d');
    cout << a << " " << b << "\n";

    String line = "Hello, " + shout("Jao");
    cout << line << " (" << line.len << " characters)\n";
    cout << line.find("Jao") << " " << line.slice(0, 5) << "\n";
    if a == "abc" { cout << "same\n"; }
}
```

Output:

```
abc abcd
Hello, Jao! (11 characters)
7 Hello
same
```

A new `String` made by an expression (`a + b`, a call, `slice`) is freed for you at the end of the statement. `s.c()` points into the String: it is valid until you change it.
A String parameter only borrows the caller's String, so inside the function you cannot assign to it.

## Lesson 14. Generics

A function or struct can take a type as a parameter: write it in `<>` after the name. The compiler makes one copy for every type you use.
A function finds the type from its arguments: `largest(3, 9)`; you can also write it, `largest<int>(3, 9)`. A struct always has it written: `Box<double>`.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

T largest<T>(T a, T b) {
    if a > b { return a; }
    return b;
}

struct Box<T> {
    T value;
    T get(self) { return self.value; }
}

void main() {
    cout << largest(3, 9) << "\n";
    cout << largest(2.5, 1.5) << "\n";
    cout << largest<int>(8, 2) << "\n";
    Box<int> b = {7};
    cout << b.get() << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
9
2.500000
8
7
```

A generic must be written before the first place that uses it. `largest(1, 2.5)` is an error (a whole number and a decimal number do not mix): write `largest(1.0, 2.5)`. When the type cannot be worked out, the compiler says so and you write it.

## Lesson 15. Lists, maps and sets

A list is a dynamic array with more tools: `sort`, `insert`, `remove`, `contains`, `index_of`. `for x in list` visits every element.
`Map<K,V>` stores values by key and `Set<T>` stores each value once. They free themselves at the end of the block.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    int[] scores = arr(4);
    scores.push(72); scores.push(95); scores.push(60);
    scores.sort();
    for s in scores { cout << s << " "; }
    cout << "\n";

    Map<String, int> ages;
    ages.put("ann", 31);
    ages.put("bob", 25);
    ages.put("ann", 32);
    cout << ages.get("ann") << " " << ages.len << "\n";
    for name in ages.keys_list() {
        cout << name << " is " << ages.get(name) << "\n";
    }

    Set<int> seen;
    for i in 0..20 { seen.add(i % 5); }
    cout << seen.len << " different, has 3: " << seen.has(3) << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
60 72 95 
32 2
ann is 32
bob is 25
5 different, has 3: true
```

`ages.get("zed")` would throw `key not found`; ask with `ages.has("zed")` first. `keys_list()` makes a new list that the `for` loop frees for you.

## Lesson 16. Lambdas

A lambda is a small function written right where you need it: `int(int a, int b) { return a + b; }`. It can be passed to a function that takes a function
pointer, or kept in a variable of type `int(int, int)^`. It cannot use the variables around it.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

int apply(int(int, int)^ f, int x, int y) {
    return f(x, y);
}

void main() {
    cout << apply(int(int a, int b) { return a + b; }, 3, 4) << "\n";
    int(int)^ triple = int(int x) { return x * 3; };
    cout << triple(5) << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
7
15
```

The types are written out, so a lambda reads like a function. If the body needs a value from outside, pass it as a parameter.

## Lesson 17. Errors with try and catch

`throw "text"` stops what you are doing and jumps to the nearest `catch`. Without a `catch` the program stops and prints `uncaught exception: text`.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

int divide(int a, int b) {
    if b == 0 { throw "cannot divide by zero"; }
    return a / b;
}

void main() {
    try {
        cout << divide(10, 2) << "\n";
        cout << divide(1, 0) << "\n";
    } catch (e) {
        cout << "error: " << e << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
5
error: cannot divide by zero
```

## Lesson 18. Decimals and the Math library

`#import <stdlib>` brings the standard library and `using stdlib` lets you write `sqrt(x)` instead of `Math::sqrt(x)` (every program that prints needs both lines; the tutorial adds them at the top). If two modules have the same function name (`write` is in `Sys` and `File`), write the module: `File::write(...)`. Casts are explicit: `(int)x`, `(double)n`.

```jk
#import <stdlib>

using stdlib;
void main() {
    double a = 3.0;
    double b = 4.0;
    cout << "hypotenuse = " << sqrt(a * a + b * b) << "\n";

    int whole = (int)floor(7.9);
    cout << whole << "\n";

    double half = (double)whole / 2.0;
    cout << half << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
hypotenuse = 5.000000
7
3.500000
```

The library has `Sys` (system calls), `Mem` (memory), `Str` (text), `Math` and `File`.

## Lesson 19. Files

`File::open(path, mode)` gives a number (negative if it failed). `read`, `write`, `read_line` and `close` use it.

```jk
#import <stdlib>

using stdlib;
void main() {
    i32 f = File::open("note.txt", FileMode::Write);
    if f < 0 { throw "cannot create note.txt"; }
    File::write(f, "J2K can write files\n");
    File::close(f);

    char line[64];
    i32 g = File::open("note.txt", FileMode::Read);
    File::read_line(g, line);
    File::close(g);
    cout << line << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
J2K can write files
```

## Lesson 20. A program in several files

A file that ends in `.jk` is a program (it has `main`). A file that ends in `.j` is a component that other files `import`; it must not have `main`.
`#import "mathx"` finds `mathx.j` next to the file; `#import "tools.mathx"` finds `tools/mathx.j`.

`mathx.j`:

```jk
// mathx.j -- a component: functions to import
int cube(int x) {
    return x * x * x;
}
```

`multi.jk`:

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

#import "mathx"

void main() {
    cout << cube(3) << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
27
```

Compile only the main file: `jcmp multi.jk -o multi`; the imported file is read automatically (once).

## Lesson 21. A small project: counting words

Putting it together: read words until the input ends (reading past the end throws `end of input`) and report how many there were and the longest.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

int length(char^ s) {
    int n = 0;
    while s[n] != 0 { n++; }
    return n;
}

void main() {
    char w[32];
    int count = 0;
    int longest = 0;
    try {
        while true {
            cin >> w;
            count++;
            int n = length(@w);
            if n > longest { longest = n; }
        }
    } catch (e) {
        // the input is over
    }
    cout << count << " words, the longest has " << longest << " letters\n";
}
```

Input: `the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`

Output:

```
9 words, the longest has 5 letters
```

Run: `echo "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" | ./wordcount`.
**Try:** also print the longest word itself.

# Part 2: toward the machine

## Lesson 22. Bits and bytes

A whole number is 64 bits. `>>` and `<<` shift them, `&` keeps bits, `xor` flips them. `Bit::` has the work that the CPU does in one instruction:
`popcount` (how many bits are 1), `clz` / `ctz` (zero bits in front / after), `rotl` / `rotr` (turn the bits round), `bswap` (reverse the 8 bytes).

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    int x = 0xB0;
    cout << x << " " << Bit::popcount(x) << " " << Bit::clz(x) << " " << Bit::ctz(x) << "\n";
    cout << (x >> 4) << " " << (x & 0xF) << " " << (x << 4) << " " << (x xor 0xFF) << "\n";
    cout << Bit::rotl(1, 63) << "\n";
    cout << Bit::bswap(0x0102030405060708) << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
176 3 56 4
11 0 2816 79
-9223372036854775808
578437695752307201
```

`0xB0` is `1011 0000` in binary: 3 bits are 1, 56 zero bits stand in front, 4 after. The last line turns the 8 bytes `01 02 ... 08` round to `08 07 ... 01`.

## Lesson 23. Numbers wider than 64 bits

When 64 bits are not enough you keep a number in several words and add word by word. `Bit::add_carry(a, b, carry_in)` gives a struct with the sum and the carry out.
`Bit::mul_wide` gives the whole 128-bit product, `Bit::div_rem` the quotient and the remainder together, `Bit::add_sat` an addition that stops at the largest number instead of wrapping.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    // (5, -1) + (0, 1) as numbers of two words: high word first
    BitCarry lo = Bit::add_carry(-1, 1, 0);
    BitCarry hi = Bit::add_carry(5, 0, lo.c);
    cout << hi.sum << " " << lo.sum << " " << hi.c << "\n";
    BitWide w = Bit::mul_wide(-1, 3);
    cout << w.hi << " " << w.lo << "\n";
    BitDivRem d = Bit::div_rem(-17, 5);
    cout << d.q << " " << d.r << "\n";
    cout << Bit::add_sat(9223372036854775807, 5) << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
6 0 0
2 -3
-3 -2

The low words `-1 + 1` give 0 with a carry of 1; the carry goes into the high words: `5 + 0 + 1 = 6`. The product `(2^64 - 1) * 3` does not fit in 64 bits: `hi` is 2 and `lo` is -3.

## Lesson 24. Looking at the code the compiler made

The compiler does not hide what it makes: `jcmp program.jk -show NAME` writes the machine code of the function `NAME` and how many instructions it has.
Small functions are often put inside their callers, so a function that is called once can have no code of its own. Here `scale` is kept because `main` calls it in a loop.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

int scale(int x, int k) {
    return (x * k) >> 2;
}

void main() {
    int total = 0;
    for i in 0..10 { total += scale(i, 6); }
    cout << total << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
65
```

The code of `scale` that the compiler made:

```
scale:
mul x0, x0, x1
asr x0, x0, #2
L8118:
ret
// 3 instructions
```

Run `jcmp showcode.jk -show scale` to see the lines above (they are the code of the ARM64 target). On another target the instructions are other ones.

## Lesson 25. Keeping the code short: #expect

A hot function should stay small. `#expect instructions <= N` in front of a function makes the compiler stop, with the real count, when the function grows past N: after a change of your program, or a new compiler.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

#expect instructions <= 12
int clamp(int x, int lo, int hi) {
    if x < lo { return lo; }
    if x > hi { return hi; }
    return x;
}

void main() {
    cout << clamp(-5, 0, 10) << " " << clamp(7, 0, 10) << " " << clamp(99, 0, 10) << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
0 7 10
```

Try `#expect instructions <= 2` and compile again: the compiler says how many instructions the function really has.

## Lesson 26. Threads and atomic operations

`Thread` runs a function at the same time as the others. Two threads that do `counter += 1` can lose counts, because the CPU reads, adds and writes in three steps. `Atomic::add` does the three steps as one that nobody can break.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

#import <cpu>
using cpu::thread;

int counter;

void work(void^ arg) {
    for i in 0..10000 { Atomic::add(@counter, 1); }
}

void main() {
    Thread a = create(work, null);
    Thread b = create(work, null);
    Thread c = create(work, null);
    a.join();
    b.join();
    c.join();
    cout << counter << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
30000
```

`Atomic::` also has `cas` (change a value only if it is what you expect), `swap`, `load`, `store`, `bit_or` and others, and `Mem::barrier()` orders the memory accesses of one thread against the others.

## Lesson 27. Registers: the register block

The CPU keeps the numbers it works on in registers, named `x0` ... `x30`. A `register { }` block lets you write instructions with those registers. `in x1 = a;` puts a value in a register before the block, `out x0 = r;` takes one out after it, and `clobber x4;` says that you use `x4` for your own work.
Inside the block every statement is one instruction.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

int add_mul(int a, int b, int c) {
    int r = 0;
    register {
        in x1 = a;
        in x2 = b;
        in x3 = c;
        clobber x4;
        x4 = x1 + x2;
        x0 = x4 * x3;
        out x0 = r;
    }
    return r;
}

void main() {
    cout << add_mul(2, 3, 4) << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
20
```

`(2 + 3) * 4 = 20`. The same source builds for the ARM64 and the ARM32 target (the names `x0 ...` are the same on both).

## Lesson 28. A function with nothing around it: naked and svc

A `naked` function has no prologue and no epilogue: the body is all there is, and the arguments are in `x0`, `x1`, ... The statement `svc(0);` asks the kernel for a service; the number of the service is in `x8`.
Here is `write` (number 64) written by hand, with no library at all.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

naked int my_write(int fd, char^ buf, int n) {
    Reg::x8 = 64;
    svc(0);
    ret;
}

void main() {
    char msg[6] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\n'};
    int n = my_write(1, @msg, 6);
    cout << n << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
hello
6
```

`write(1, buffer, 6)` sends 6 bytes to the standard output and returns how many it wrote. `ret;` goes back to the caller with the result in `x0`.

## Lesson 29. The flags of the CPU

After an addition or a comparison the CPU keeps four flags: `n` (negative), `z` (zero), `c` (carry) and `v` (overflow). C hides them; here you can read them. `Cpu::inst("adds", ...)` is the instruction `adds`, which sets the flags, and `Flags::c` reads one of them as 0 or 1.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

int carry_of(int a, int b) {
    int r = 0;
    register {
        in x1 = a;
        in x2 = b;
        Cpu::inst("adds", Reg::x3, Reg::x1, Reg::x2);
        x0 = Flags::c;
        out x0 = r;
    }
    return r;
}

void main() {
    cout << carry_of(-1, 1) << " " << carry_of(1, 2) << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
1 0
```

`-1` is all bits 1, so `-1 + 1` carries out of the top: the flag is 1. `1 + 2` does not: 0. (This lesson is for the ARM64 target.)

## Lesson 30. Machine words you write yourself

At the bottom there is nothing but numbers. `raw<u32>[...]` puts a 32-bit machine word in the code, exactly as you wrote it. The instruction `add x1, x1, #2` of the ARM64 CPU is the number `0x91000821`; `nop` is `0xd503201f`.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    int v = 5;
    register {
        in x1 = v + 1;
        raw<u32>[0xd503201f];
        raw<u32>[0x91000821];
        out x1 = v;
    }
    cout << v << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
8
```

`5 + 1 = 6`, then the word adds 2: 8. These numbers are for ARM64; on the ARM32 target the same instruction is another word (`0xE2811002`), so a program that writes raw words is for one CPU.

# Part 3: to the bone

## Lesson 31. Addresses and bytes

A variable lives at an address. `@x` is that address and a pointer holds it. A `char^` looks at memory one byte at a time, so you can see how an `int` is stored: the CPU is little-endian, the lowest byte comes first. Pointers into one array are as far apart as the size of the elements. `(int)q - (int)p` is the distance in bytes.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    int x = 0x0102030405060708;
    char^ b = (char^)@x;
    for i in 0..8 { cout << (b[i] & 255) << " "; }
    cout << "\n";
    int a[4];
    for i in 0..4 { a[i] = i * 10; }
    int^ p = @a[0];
    int^ q = @a[3];
    cout << ((int)q - (int)p) << " " << (p == @a[0]) << " " << (q^) << "\n";
    cout << sizeof(int) << " " << sizeof(char) << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 
24 true 30
8 1
```

`0x0102030405060708` is stored as `08 07 ... 01`. Four `int`s are 32 bytes, so `a[3]` is 24 bytes after `a[0]`. When you print the address of a variable (`cout << p;`) you get `0x...`; here we print distances because an address changes from run to run.

## Lesson 32. Talking to the kernel

A program does nothing alone: writing, memory and the process id all come from the kernel through system calls. `Sys::` is a thin layer over them: `Sys::write(file, buffer, bytes)`, `Sys::getpid()`, `Sys::mmap(bytes)` (a fresh block of memory from the system, the base of every allocator) and `Sys::munmap`. No library code sits in between, one call is one `svc` instruction.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    char msg[8];
    msg[0] = 'h'; msg[1] = 'i'; msg[2] = '\n';
    Sys::write(1, @msg, 3);
    int pid = Sys::getpid();
    cout << (pid > 0) << "\n";
    void^ page = Sys::mmap(4096);
    int^ words = (int^)page;
    for i in 0..512 { words[i] = i * i; }
    cout << words[511] << "\n";
    Sys::munmap(page, 4096);
}
```

Output:

```
hi
true
261121
```

`mmap` gives whole pages (4096 bytes) that are zero at the start. `cout` itself ends in `Sys::write`. For any call the library does not name there is `Sys::call(number, a0 ... a5)` and the `svc` of lesson 28.

## Lesson 33. Your own allocator

The fastest allocator is a pointer that only moves forward (a bump allocator): ask for a block, add its size to `top`, done. There is no `free` for one object; you give the whole block back at once. This is what an arena does, and it is why compilers and games use it. The block comes from `mmap`.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

int^ heap;
int top;

int^ bump(int n) {
    int^ p = @heap[top];
    top += n;
    return p;
}

void main() {
    heap = (int^)Sys::mmap(65536);
    int^ a = bump(4);
    int^ b = bump(4);
    for i in 0..4 { a[i] = i; b[i] = i * 100; }
    cout << a[3] + b[3] << " " << top << " " << ((int)b - (int)a) << "\n";
    Sys::munmap(heap, 65536);
}
```

Output:

```
303 8 32
```

Both blocks sit side by side: `b` is 32 bytes after `a`, and `top` counts 8 `int`s. The standard library has this ready as `Arena`; writing it once shows there is no magic in an allocator.

## Lesson 34. A spinlock

Lesson 26 used `Atomic::add`. For a bigger piece of work (several statements that must not be mixed) you need a lock. A spinlock is one `int`: 0 is free, 1 is taken. `Atomic::cas(@lock, 0, 1)` changes it to 1 only if it was 0 and gives the old value, so exactly one thread wins. The others spin; `Cpu::pause()` tells the CPU it is a spin loop (it saves power and helps the other hyper-thread).

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

#import <cpu>
using cpu::thread;

int lock;
int counter;

void work(void^ arg) {
    for i in 0..10000 {
        while Atomic::cas(@lock, 0, 1) != 0 { Cpu::pause(); }
        counter += 1;
        Atomic::store(@lock, 0);
    }
}

void main() {
    Thread a = create(work, null);
    Thread b = create(work, null);
    a.join();
    b.join();
    cout << counter << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
20000
```

`counter += 1` is now safe although it is three steps, because only the thread that holds the lock runs it. `Atomic::store` releases the lock with the right memory order, so the new `counter` is seen by the next thread. A spinlock is right for very short work; for long waits use a lock that sleeps.

## Lesson 35. Counting the clock of the CPU

`Cpu::counter()` reads the system counter of the CPU (no system call, a few cycles) and `Cpu::frequency()` says how many ticks make a second. It is the most exact stopwatch you have. To time code: read, run, read, subtract. `Bit::popcount` is one instruction on the CPU, so a million of them are quick.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;

void main() {
    int start = Cpu::counter();
    int sum = 0;
    for i in 0..1000000 { sum += Bit::popcount(i); }
    int ticks = Cpu::counter() - start;
    cout << sum << " " << (ticks > 0) << " " << (Cpu::frequency() > 0) << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
9884992 true true
```

The sum is fixed, the time is not, so the program prints only whether the time was measured. Measure more than once: the first run warms the cache. With `#expect instructions <= N` (lesson 25) you guard the size, with the counter you guard the time.

## Lesson 36. Vectors in the hardware

Graphics and physics work on groups of numbers. `vec3` is three `double`s with the operators `+ - *`, and its parts are picked by letter (`c.zyx` is the same three numbers in the reverse order). For many numbers at once the CPU has SIMD registers (NEON on ARM): the compiler turns loops over arrays into vector instructions by itself, and `#import <simd>` gives the lanes by name.

```jk
#import <stdlib>
using stdlib;
#import <math>
using math::vector;

void main() {
    vec3 a = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
    vec3 b = {4.0, 5.0, 6.0};
    vec3 c = a + b * 2.0;
    cout << c.x << " " << c.y << " " << c.z << "\n";
    cout << c.zyx.x << "\n";
}
```

Output:

```
9.000000 12.000000 15.000000
15.000000
```

`a + b * 2.0` is `(1,2,3) + (8,10,12)`. Use `jcmp file.jk -show NAME` (lesson 24) on a loop over a `double` array to see the vector instructions.
